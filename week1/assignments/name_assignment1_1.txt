My name is Sean Mussenden, and I'm finishing up a MIM degree from the University of Maryland iSchool. I live in Hyattsville, Maryland, and I have a dog named Barney, a lab.  In my spare time I like to meditate, rock climb, hike, watch soccer and read.  I work at the University of Maryland, as a professor of data journalism in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism and as data editor of the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism.
