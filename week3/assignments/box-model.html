The CSS Box Model is a phrase that describes the way HTML and CSS combine to arrange the flow of styled text and other content on an HTML page.  When designing pages, it's best to think of each element -- whether it's text, a styled DIV, an image -- as a discreet box.  In effect, web design/development is in large part an exercise in taking a design and organizing it into boxes on the page that align with or work with other boxes on the page. 

And each box, then, has properties we can control to arrange the elements to our liking, and these properties are described in the CSS box model.

I personally find it helpful to think of a physical box when attempting to describe the CSS box model. Let's suppose we write a word on a piece of paper and put it at the center of a cardboard box.  The content sits at the center.

The space between the edge of the word and the inside edge of the box we call padding, which is a CSS property.  When we do

The edge of the cardboard box, CSS would call the border, and using the CSS border property we can change the width of the border, the style (dashed or solid or something else) and the color, or hide it entirely.

Moving outside of the box, the space between the edge of our cardboard box and another cardboard box would be called margin in CSS.  By increasing margin, we can increase the space between our box and other boxes.
